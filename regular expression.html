regular expression:

regular expression represents a text pattern

reserved charaacters:
. represents any char
* represents 0 or more
 e.g,  [0]*  matches 0000000000
+ represents 1 or more  occurances
? represents 0 or 1   occurance  [0]?  str='',str1='0'
    "3.00".replace(/[\.][0]*/,");
$ represents the end of string
^ (usage 1) represents the start of string
    (usage 2) represents NOT,used inside square bracket[]

  better write
     "3.00".replace(/[\.][0]*$/,");  delete only zeros at all, but not in the middle
   
   "abcd".replace(/^bc/,")

   [^b] means NOT b
 
   "ac".replace(/^[^b]/,'X') -->'Xc'
   "bc".replace(/^[^b]/,'X') don't match
\s  empty space,\t
\d digits
[0-9]  a single digits
[a-z] a single lower alphabet
[A-Z] a capital letter

{}   store matches string and to used later in replacing
     "xyz12*?3.5sdsd".replace(/([a-z]+)(.*)([a-z]+)/,'$1$2');
[]   holds more characters to be matched , at least one
     [0-9]
     "a".replace(/[0-9]/,")--->'a'
     "a1a".replace(/a[0-9]a/,")--->''
|     (sounds "pipe"), means logical OR
[a|b|c]  matches a or b or c

{}  specifies number of occurances:
 [a-z]{6}  means   6 letters

in js ,use RegExp class/function to create a regular expression,
    let r = new RegExp(/\[0-9]/g);
    let text = "1.ancw\n\n\n\www\n2.fgfgfgf\n\n\n3 dd";
    
    let m;
    let start = 0;
    while ((m = r.exec(text.substring(start))) != null)
    {
	let s = m.toString();//
	arr.push(s);
        let I = s.length()
	start +=I + m.index;
    

    }
